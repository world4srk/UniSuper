Steps to run the test suite: 
1. Open IntelliJ IDE
2. Import the project as a maven project
3. Install Cucumber for Java plugin
4. Set Java Home
5. Execute the testRunner.java

The test will execute on Firefox version lower than 47.0 as I have used Selenium 2.53.0

Parallel processing can be achieved by Selenium grid execute same or different test scripts on multiple platforms and browsers concurrently.
